                I proudly graduated from The University of Leeds in 2016, with a
                First-class (Hons) in Computer Science. I also received an award
                for academic excellence two years in a row during my time at
                University.

                I thoroughly enjoyed my degree. I enjoyed the challenges it

                I worked hard, and it paid off, and that has enabled me to do
                something as a job every day, which feels much more like a
                hobby.
