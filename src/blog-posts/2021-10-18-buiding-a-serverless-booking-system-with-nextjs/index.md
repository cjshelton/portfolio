# Introduction

My family recently acquired a static caravan to be shared throughout the year as a place to have a break. My first thought
was "This will be great", and my second thought, like most other software engineers, was "I think a custom booking system
is in order here".

Jokes aside, something was needed to help coordinate who's in the caravan and when throughout the year, and I
saw this as an opportunity to see how quickly I could get something working in the space of a few evenings, using serverless
technology and SaaS products, with zero setup or operating costs.

I achieved my goal with the help of Next.js, TypeScript, Auth0, Supabase and Netlify (for hosting and serverless functions).
Read on to find out more about these technologies and how they helped me achieve my goal.
