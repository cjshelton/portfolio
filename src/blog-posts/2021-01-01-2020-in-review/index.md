# Introduction

This post will be a look back on some of the highlights of my tech journey in 2020, including new tech I have learnt and new projects I have worked on.

# Highlights

## Building My Personal Portfolio Using Gatsby {#building-my-personal-portfolio-using-gatsby}

Building my personal Portfolio site in [Gatsby][gatsby-url] was the largest personal project I worked on in 2020, particularly
over Lockdown. I wanted my own Portfolio site to act as a central place to showcase my potential, and to be a living document
of my career as a software engineer, and ultimately be the home for my tech blog, which I'll get onto later.

I opted not to use a site builder or cookie-cutter template, but instead, take the opportunity to learn a new set of
technologies, including the Gatsby JAMstack platform, as well as React and a bit of GraphQL, all whilst further
strengthening my HTML and CSS skills.

This was a really enjoyable project to work on, and is now in a perfect place for me to keep it up-to-date and make
hassle-free edits as and when I need to.

## Web-hosting Using Netlify

Whilst [building my Portfolio](#building-my-personal-portfolio-using-gatsby), I started investigating options for web
hosting. Netlify quickly seemed like the obvious choice, particularly in the JAMstack world.

Netlify proved to be very easy from start to finish. From connecting the source code repository, setting up any
build and deployment commands, and finally setting up any notifications to be sent on success or failure of a deployment.
I also managed to connect my own private domain and setup DNS in Netlify easily, following their excellent documentation.

And best of all, this is all under their free-plan offering - ideal for any of your own small personal projects.

Netlify is a very impressive platform for hosting modern front-end applications, and will always remain at the top of my
list for any future projects. I feel I have only scratched the surface of what Netlify can offer, even under the free plan,
so I certainly plan on exploring more with Netlify in 2021.

## Tech Blog Migration Into Portfolio

Another goal I set for 2020 was to migrate my tech blog from GitHub Pages over to be integrated into my Portfolio site.
My reasoning for doing this was to simplify maintenance for myself, and to have some consistency for my online presence.

I achieved this goal about halfway through the year. It wasn't as time consuming as I anticipated, and certainly allowed
me to delve deeper into Gatsby, and how it can be leveraged to create a blog site, including using Markdown to write
the content.

I have posted a few times on my blog since the migration was completed and I have certainly felt the benefits I was
hoping for, and I certainly appreciate having all of my content in one place and the consistent look-and-feel it has
throughout.
