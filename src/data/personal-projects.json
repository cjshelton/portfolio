It stops app execution shortly after running and logs an error to make it easier to identify dependency problems, which is more helpful than the app starting, but then throwing an error when HTTP requests are made to the app.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"section-text\">I decided back in 2018 that I wanted to create a tech blog. I wanted it to be a space where I could document some of the things I have learnt for future reference, and also write-up solutions to problems in order to help others; I&apos;ve lost count of the times I have been helped by reading others&apos; blog posts, so I decided it would be a good opportunity to give back.</p><p class=\"section-text\">I weighed up my options &mdash; to use a blogging software or build my own. Aside from every developer's desire to &quot;write their own&quot;, Jamstack was really gaining traction at the time as way of creating static sites like blogs using simpler and more modern techniques, so I opted for creating a Jamstack blog using Jekyll. I learnt a lot from creating the blog &mdash; it gave me experience and an understanding of how powerful Static Site Generators can be, and also helped solidify some of my earlier CSS skills, relying only lightly on Bootstrap and writing a lot of custom SCSS myself.</p><p class=\"section-text\">My blog is still active today, though my posts aren't as frequent as I&apos;d like. It is hosted independently on GitHub Pages at the moment, though I have plans to migrate it over to my Portfolio site which uses GatsbyJS.</p>",
